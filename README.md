# Text2UnitAligner
A simple and easy-to-use automatic forced aligner based on a praat built-in function.
This script takes an audio (.WAV) file and a plaintext (.txt) file with the transcription of the audio.
Script, audio and text files must be in the same folder.
For testing the script, we provide a pair of audio/plaintext files (he_drives_a_black_car.wav / he_drives_a_black_car.txt) 
available in theis repository.

updates will be added soon in: <https://github.com/leonidasjr/Text2UnitAligner>.
