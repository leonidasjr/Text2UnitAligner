# Text2UnitAligner
A simple and easy-to-use automatic forced aligner based on a praat built-in function.
This script takes an audio (.WAV) file and a plaintext (.txt) file with the transcription of the audio.
Script, audio and text files must be in the same folder.

A pair of audio/plaintext files [he_drives_a_black_car.wav / he_drives_a_black_car.txt] is available for testing the script.
